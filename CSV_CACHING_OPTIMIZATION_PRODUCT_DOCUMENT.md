## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Current State Issues

#### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Long-lived signed URLs**: 30-minute expiration created extended attack windows
- **URL exposure risk**: Compromised URLs remained valid for extended periods
- **No proactive security measures**: Static expiration times regardless of usage patterns

#### 2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
- **Repeated Cloudinary fetches**: Every query triggered fresh file downloads
- **High latency**: 2-5 second delays per query due to external API calls
- **Bandwidth waste**: Same CSV data downloaded multiple times per session

#### 3. **Cost Inefficiencies**
- **Excessive API calls**: Each query = new Cloudinary request
- **Bandwidth costs**: Repeated downloads of identical data
- **Resource waste**: Server resources spent on redundant operations

#### 4. **User Experience Issues**
- **Cache expiration interruptions**: Users hit 30-minute limits during work sessions
- **Inconsistent performance**: Variable response times based on external service health
- **No session continuity**: Work sessions interrupted by cache expiration

    A[User Selects CSV] --> B[Frontend Triggers Cache]
    B --> C[10-min Signed URL Generated]
    C --> D[Download from Cloudinary]
    D --> E[Store in Redis with Gzip]
    E --> F[2-hour Cache TTL]
    F --> G[User Makes Queries]
    G --> H[Check Redis Cache First]
    H --> I{Cache Hit?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Process from Cache]
    I -->|No| K[Fetch from Cloudinary]
    K --> L[Cache in Redis]
    L --> J

    O -->|Yes + Active User| P[Proactive Refresh]
    O -->|No| Q[Continue Monitoring]
    P --> R[Extend TTL by 2 hours]
    R --> Q
```

### Core Components

#### 1. **Frontend Integration**
- **Automatic caching trigger**: CSV selection initiates server-side caching
- **Optimized signed URLs**: Reduced from 30 minutes to 10 minutes
- **User experience**: Seamless background caching without user intervention

#### 2. **Backend Redis Caching**
- **Compressed storage**: Gzip compression reduces memory usage by ~60%
- **User isolation**: Separate cache keys per user (`csv_data:{user_id}:{file_id}`)
- **Smart TTL**: 2-hour expiration with proactive refresh for active users

#### 3. **Processing Service Integration**
- **Cache-first approach**: All services check Redis before Cloudinary
- **Graceful fallback**: Automatic Cloudinary fetch if cache miss
- **Dual caching**: Both `data_analysis_service` and `csv_to_sql_converter` optimized

#### 4. **Proactive Refresh System**
- **Activity tracking**: Monitor user query patterns
- **Smart refresh**: Only refresh for users active within 30 minutes
- **Background service**: Automated monitoring every 3 minutes
- **Graceful degradation**: Silent failure handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Features

#### 1. **Reduced Signed URL Expiration**
```typescript
// Before: 30 minutes
signedUrlService.getSignedUrl(fileId, 0.5)

// After: 10 minutes  
signedUrlService.getSignedUrl(fileId, 0.167)
```

#### 2. **Redis Caching with Compression**
```python
# Compress CSV content to save memory
compressed_content = gzip.compress(csv_content.encode('utf-8'))
result = self.redis_client.setex(key, ttl, compressed_content)
```

#### 3. **Activity-Based Proactive Refresh**
```python
# Track user activity for smart refresh decisions
activity_key = f"user_activity:{user_id}:{file_id}"
self.redis_client.setex(activity_key, 3600, current_time)
```

#### 4. **Cache-First Processing**
```python
# Check Redis cache first, fallback to Cloudinary
cached_content = redis_service.get_cached_csv_data(user_id, file_id)
if cached_content:
    return pd.read_csv(StringIO(cached_content))
```

### API Endpoints

#### New Endpoints Added
- `POST /files/cache-csv/{file_id}` - Trigger server-side caching
- `POST /files/refresh-cache/{file_id}` - Manual cache refresh
- `GET /files/cache-status` - Cache statistics and health
