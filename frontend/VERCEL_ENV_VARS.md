# Vercel Environment Variables Configuration

## Required Environment Variables for Vercel Deployment

Configure these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### Core Application Settings
- `VITE_APP_ENV` = `production`
- `VITE_DEBUG` = `false`
- `VITE_APP_NAME` = `Custard` (optional, defaults to "Custard")
- `VITE_APP_VERSION` = `1.0.0` (optional, defaults to "1.0.0")

### API Configuration
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = Your backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-domain.com/api/v1`)

## Environment Variable Setup in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable above with the appropriate values
4. Make sure to set them for Production environment
5. Redeploy your application after adding the variables

## Notes

- The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to your backend API endpoint
- If not set, the app will default to `/api/v1` (relative path)
- All environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are available in the frontend code
- The build process will embed these values into the production bundle
